To get started type "make", once built run "./anircd" 

It requires an SSL private key / cert pair (PEM format) in the file 'ircd.pem'
in order to function, and gnutls libs/headers. It may be compiled without SSL
by removing -DSSL_GNUTLS CFLAG and the appropriate libgnutls-config LDFLAGS and
CFLAGS.

For a self-signed certificate:
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096	# gen key
# here, the CN (Common Name) must be the server name
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -out cert.pem -key key.pem
cat key.pem cert.pem > ircd.pem
rm -f key.pem cert.pem
